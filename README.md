# Flags Of The World
This project demonstrates how to use Trio's collections feature to generate a collection of detail pages driven by the items in the source/data/worlds.json file.

The home page is a catalog of all the recognized flags of the world. Clicking the links on this page renders the detail page for the item clicked. There are a total of 249 flags and 249 detail pages, one for each flag, generated.
